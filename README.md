# Cynthia's Bitburner Scripts Repository
Welcome! This is where I put my Bitburner scripts in.

Important note: **Most** of the scripts were ran and tested in the latest prod versions and **should** be good to use. However,
if you want to make sure that everything works as you want them to, make sure to read through the code.

Start with those scripts which I frequently use (under `/scripts/`):
* `boot.js`: Starts up everything needed after a reboot. May be configured with flags.
* `buy_server.js`: Automatically buys (and sells if necessary) servers whenever possible. Configure min and max RAM by changing values of the constants the top.
* `gangs_my.js`: A simple script that automates gang managament.
* `crimes.js`: Automates earning money through crimes. Singularity API required.
* `transport_files.js`: Updates remotely enabled scripts on all servers.
* `hack.js`: Main hacking script.
